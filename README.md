# PepperKinematics
Forward and inverse kinematics for the robot Pepper and a dataset of angle combinations and the corresponding end effector positions of both virtual and physical robot. The method is explained in more detailed in the following paper: 
- Analytical Solution of Pepper's Inverse Kinematics for a Pose Matching Imitation System

## Requirements
- Python 2.7 (numpy)
